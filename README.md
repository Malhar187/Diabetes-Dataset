# Diabetes-Dataset Overview:
The dataset was given by the instructor, on which ML Modeling was already carried out. I created a new EDA file which is submitted in Moodle.

# EDA:
I created 3 charts:
1. Bar Chart for Distribution of Gender
2. Bar Chart for Distribution of Age
3. Bar Chart for Distribution of Class

Then I generated different insights from the visualizations, that are mentioned in the colab notebook.
